# Defensive Data Transfer
This project was created as a part of the [Barclays Data Stellar Hackathon]conducted at SP-IT college.

# Our Solution
A CLI solution to transfer big data (up to several GBs) from an on-premise database to cloud **SECURELY**\
A cutting-edge solution that guarantees the safe and confidential transmission of sensitive data over networks. 
With the rising threats of data breaches and cyberattacks, safeguarding information during its journey from sender to receiver is of paramount importance. 
This project addresses this concern by implementing powerful security mechanism: the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm
